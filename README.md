Noell - 
I made the scene. I accidentally deleted everything and I couldn't restore it (lol) so I tried to remake it as fast as I could. I added various assets and moved things so I think it looks ok, I guess.
I had a lot of problems with getting the terrain to cooperate with me. It's definitely different to working with scripts. It takes a lot of time and concentration to set up a scene. 
I don't think I have the fantasy for this 
I have a lot of admiration for the people who do this for a living. The attention to detail and stuff. Damn. Anyhow, it was interesting to try.
